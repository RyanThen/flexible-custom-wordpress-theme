# Flexible Custom Wordpress Theme

This repository is dedicated to a flexible custom WordPress theme that I built using a Udemy course and later customized independently.  I frequently use the code in this theme as a reference when building custom WordPress themes.  This repo is still growing and is full of high quality code that I know front to back.
